      <p>
        Hey! You can call me Gui. After 10 years in the same job I decided to
        find a new path and the Development area caught me. Since then, it is
        been more than a year since I started studying, and Front-End got me. I
        studied with several different paths and courses with Rocketseat and
        CursoEmVideo, Iam always participating in events like NLW and DevWeek by
        Alura and the amazing YouTube. Now I am looking for an opportunity to
        enter the market, to grow as a professional and as a person. Find a
        company or project that will make me evolve completely. My current focus
        in studies is being Javascript and ReactJS and React Native.
